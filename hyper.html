        <h1 data-aos="fade-down">ResearchIT's Work and Ideas: Our Journey and Vision</h1>
        <p>Hey,</p>
        <p>so this is kinda like a 10-minute read.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">Conventionally, this should be formal, concise, and brief, yea? But then we're not trying to sound stiff or robotic, i mean, you've read enough GPT written literature. so, i'd try as much to write this in a language that most of us can resonate with, and yes there'd be no cuss words or derogatory remarks.
            ResearchIT is about a year old now, and I want to bring everybody on the same page.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">So, if you want to dig into stuff like why we are, where we messed up, where we were geniuses, and what’s next, then read on.</p>
        <a href="/index.html">home <img src="arrow.png" class="filler" alt=""></a>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">Else, TLDR:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We will take on 'xlve', a million dollar project, you watch and see</li>
            <li>massive growth in a bit</li>
            <li>Turn down a non-compliant alluring government deal.</li>
            <li>We want to do even better in subsequent years.</li>
            <li>Delaying our big summer project.</li>
            <li>We're building a groundbreaking product.</li>
            <li>We're hiring — a lot.</li>
            <li>Nah, that's cap. we are seeking volunteers hehe</li>
        </ul>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">Farza said, and i couldn't agree less, "As founders, our job isn’t to be more likable, it isn’t to pretend like everything is okay or to be fine with average — it’s to xolve the problem we set out to xolve at the highest level possible." And, holy shit, we picked the stem of it all — problems.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">I started this initiative at 15. I’m about 17 now. A lot has changed. The days are difficult, my hair is going grey. maybe not the last part, but then things are turning real, moving fast, and I’ve never been more excited.</p>
        
        <h2 data-aos="fade-down">The Beginning</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">In 2021, we {Daniel and I} started graphic design and freelancing, in some sense. Then in 2022, we ended up building a film studio & company whose services were utilized in various events and even a fashion show at our high school. It was focused on not just shooting the videos but understanding the core concepts of the ideas, branding and crafting a story that each frame would tell.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">In 2023, we took a massive risk deciding to kinda pivot away from the film idea, to a new direction.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">We called it ResearchIT. At the time, I had very little idea what ResearchIT was, but the core principles were clear: modern-day education is stuck in the rat race of degrees and certificates, quality education neither cheap nor easily assessible, tech was catching on, and most tech startups {esp. in our part pf the world} we're either trite or cliche' --they weren't exactly solving problems. What if there was a place where people simply work on things they were passionate about, take on the world's pressing issues and dare to disrupt conventions? We wanted to prove that if you work on things you love, and you do it well enough, you’ll find greater success and enjoyment, not only for you but for the world.</p>
        
        <p data-aos="fade-left">By late 2023, the 'company' was making and gaining traction, you know, until it wasn't. Things came into our lives, things that weren't exactly ours to control. There was college, and personal brands, and jobs...These were essential stuffs tho, as per youngsters. So, we took a halt and decided to re-brand. well, here we are with a bunch of cool new things. We're making {xlve}, a fun series where creatives could build alongside us, like “build your testing system with us” or “build your NFT-based video game.” you dig?</p>
        
        <h2 data-aos="fade-down">Pivotal Moment</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">so, we started to pitch our ideas to a couple of guys, devs, founders, and those proficient and recognized in selected niches, and a large % of them fell in love with it. actually, xlve would be more than just side projects, more than a base. We would collab and build them into full-fledged products that they either turned into revenue-generating businesses or put on their portfolio to apply for jobs. We saw this and we decide to take a big risk. We decided to stop working on our films and personal stuffs. anticipate though, for we become yet.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">We hope people join xlve and use them, at least,  as a starting blueprint to build their own ideas --we saw a hole in the market. We felt communities like Genztechies were a fantastic home for tech enthusiasts to chill and have fun talking and reading texts, and that techies and creatives are regarded very differently when in reality, it's all art. Plus, universities were an okay home for people that simply wanted to join the workforce. In all, these said guys are all solving problems, but maybe not the ones they want to xolve, or not the right ones. We wanted to serve the people in the middle.</p>
        
        <h2 data-aos="fade-down">Nights & Weekends</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">So we decided to take a chance to focus on this kinda wacky idea, so we joined something called “Nights & Weekends.” Although thats literally how we worked even before we heard of buildspace. We wanted to create something that felt like the TV shows we watched when we were kids. Where you’d watch it every week like it was a big event, obsess over it with your friends after, and continue talking about it online with other fans. And you’ll have badges and things of the sort you can proudly identify with.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">There, our goals aligned, and it felt like we were part of something bigger.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">So, we built it. N&W was six weeks where you could start any idea from zero on your nights and weekends, and by the end, you would have your first fans, revenue, downloads, whatever. They truly didn’t care what you were working on — it could have been a breakthrough AI product, a niche TikTok account, whatever.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">Now we, unlike n&w, will gave people weekly live lectures, spaces, funny skits, anime music videos, and a common goal...we're not just coming together, but we are assembling to take on challenges of the real world. Want to find out about cancer, well we're writing our research paper on that, join in — all sorts of stuff to push them to create + make progress each week and feel together. And, it would all end with an event where all the could come togetheryk, with food and drinks.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">It was all stuff that we would have wanted in such a program — because we ourselves were always working on random side stuff but of course didn’t want to join a random “course” or online “residency.” We just wanted a cool place where we could mess around and do meaningful stuffs yk, not just vent on the government. From the outside, it all looked kinda crazy and weird. </p>
        <!-- insert achievements here -->
        <!-- But, guess what… -->
        <!-- <p data-aos="fade-left">In the last year, Nights & Weekends has ended up becoming the largest accelerator in the world for any idea.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">We have now run four “seasons” of Nights & Weekends. And over time the program took on a life of its own. It became a place where makers and creatives of all types gathered to start their next thing — we had people creating YouTube channels, launching indie SaaS businesses, developing indie games, recording their metal albums, manufacturing jackets for dogs, even a team building a computer with neurons. All in one place.</p>
         -->
        <h2 data-aos="fade-down">Impact</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">It feels impossible to recap every great idea that took its shape and form. Impossible to recap every individual that took a bet on themselves and pursued their passions. Impossible to recap every story about how ResearchIT affected their lives. But we do have some numbers:</p>
        <!-- insert impact here -->
        <!-- <ul>
            <li>12M+ people saw our content across Instagram and Twitter.</li>
            <li>More than 30,000 people joined Nights & Weekends to work on their own ideas.</li>
            <li>3,000+ ended up actually building their ideas, shipping them, and getting their first fans/revenue.</li>
            <li>1,000 people flew to meet us and others like them for 3 days across 5 events and 2 cities – SF & Dubai.</li>
        </ul> -->
        <p data-aos="fade-left">In a world where Mark Zuckerberg has 1 billion DAUs, these numbers seem minuscule, even ignorable. But, when you scroll through this page – you quickly realize what 3,000 unique people working on their own ideas actually looks like.</p>
        
        <h2 data-aos="fade-down">Challenges</h2>
        <!-- <p data-aos="fade-left">Our biggest issue: the entirety of ResearchIT is duct-taped together via email, Discord, YouTube Live, Framer pages, WhatsApp, Insta, and Twitter. We don't have tight control around the quality of the experience — we sorta just hope that you'd be checking these various platforms and stay connected.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">This would be okay in recent series of xlve, but we believe that ResearchIT improves dramatically as more people join in because there's a much higher chance you meet others like you.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">For example, if you're a musician in Pakistan and you don't know any other musicians — ResearchIT gives you a massive power-up. All of a sudden you have a shot at finding other musicians to chat with, get feedback, and be motivated by. Historically we leaned a lot on Twitter for this. Users would share their work on socials and find other ResearchIT members in the wild. But in S4, we saw the duct tape starting to tear.
        </p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">We saw amazing builders getting zero traffic on their posts because the Twitter algorithm was changing constantly, you could no longer keep track of interesting projects because there were just so many, participants no longer had an efficient way to find others like them. Even our team constantly missed incredible demos that were posted on Twitter. From the outside, S4 was still a huge success. But, we knew the experience could have been 10x better.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">Overall, we're glad we hacked it together for a year. We learned a lot and wasted no time. But we want to reach higher. To do something new, yet familiar. We believe the only way to make ResearchIT bigger and better, something that can help millions to pursue their passions, is to improve the core experience of being a part of it.</p>
         -->
        <h2 data-aos="fade-down">The Future</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">So — we're finally going to build a product that can do that. And we’re excited as hell about it. It's going to revolve around what makes ResearchIT most special: its people, its community. And I’ll be honest, we’re very early. We barely know what it even looks like right now lol. We’re going to look at the ResearchIT experience holistically and build a product that feels cohesive to an existing user, yet fresh to a new user.</p>
        <p data-aos="fade-left"> But, we know we definitely don’t want to build “xlve, but as an app” or build something like “groupchat for builders.” Hell no.
            I know it all sounds hand wavy. But, we have those magical paper sketches that are often the start of all of our good ideas. And we feel good.</p>

        <h2 data-aos="fade-down">What We Believe In</h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">
            We plan to remain an innovative at our core. I want to be clear though — this doesn’t entirely mean mean we’re going to build a for-profit product (ex. a course platform, a better way to do homework, trasfer money thru your mind etc). I think “startups,” at least in my part of the world, has become parred with "money generation". They are now more of businesses, and thats not bad, i mean, not entirely, but in our eyes — profit isn’t the major goal for startups. with social media, you can pretty much sell anything at this point, but what matters is if you're solving a problem and efficiently shipping that to the right people. Startups aren't something you create to sell, i think that's misunderstood...its in an of itself efficient novel and innovative solute. It’s the path you can climb towards something greater, it’s the people you meet along the way on the shared struggle, and it’s the promise that if you go through the system you’ll come out the other side better able to navigate this world and pursue your goals.
        </p>


        <p data-aos="fade-left">
            And today, we believe existing communities and initiatives aren’t fulfilling that promise. Too often now I see — teenagers become nothing more than exam machines, college new-grads struggling to find jobs, software devs [as workers]adults grinding through useless certificates in the hope of something better. The existing system has told us that if we continue to collect skills, grades, and credentials, we will get where we want to go.
        </p>


        <p data-aos="fade-left">
            But, I’m not seeing this anymore
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-left">
            I’ve had more luck using my experience on facebook to create lasting and meaningful relationships than in my actual high school. I’ve been able to more deeply explore my academic passions via mere reading and YouTube than my school's classes. And, I’ve made more friends via discord than in my actual dorm. well, maybe not the friends part. but you get my point. So then… what did I actually get out of school?
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-left">
            And the sad reality is that today, many people are starting to ask this same question. Whats the point of it all. ngl, i won't cite myself as an example, but then i know some guys who haven't gotten into uni, but are pretty better than some said professors in the same niche. Who then said its only the traditionally accepted elites that should xolve these problems. And in parallel, we’re seeing more and more people turning towards alternatives: new residencies, gap years, accelerators, side hustles, etc. All in the hope to find something more.
        </p>

        <p data-aos="fade-left">
            We’re now in a very unique place to capitalize on this shift. And with our new product, we’re in a good spot to build the system of the future. Our mission isn’t to just xolve problems, it's to learn, xolve, and help you be creative and collaborative while at it. — it’s to help you pursue what you’re passionate about and find your people, and essentially market it to the right audience, the www.
        </p>

        <h2 data-aos="fade-down">
            What’s Next
        </h2>

        <p data-aos="fade-left">
            With all this being said, this is what you should expect from us in 2024:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We’re planning on spending most of the year developing this new product.</li>
            <li>
                We’re running xlve s1.
            </li>
            <li>We’re focused on making the highest-quality content we can.</li>
            <li>
                We'll be testing this new product in very early alpha with a small group. We’re aiming for a broader launch subsequently.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p data-aos="fade-left">
            Thank you to everyone for being part of our journey so far. you would have noticed our UI and language is similar to <a href="https://www.buildspace.so">buildspace's.</a> That's cause we're an offshoot from their product n&w, and they're cool hehe. We are immensely grateful to all of you who have supported us and taken a bet on us and yourselves. If you’ve made it this far, thank you for reading. If you have any questions or thoughts, feel free to reach out.
