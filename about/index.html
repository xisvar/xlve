         <h1 data-aos="fade-down">xlve: Our Journey and Vision</h1>
         <p>Hey,</p>
         <p>so this is kinda like a 10-minute read.</p>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">Conventionally, this should be formal, concise, and brief, yea? But then we're not trying to sound stiff or robotic, I mean, you've read enough GPT-written literature. So, I'd try as much to write this in a language that most of us can resonate with, and yes, there'd be no cuss words or derogatory remarks. xlve is about building a new kind of platform, and I want to bring everybody on the same page.</p>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">So, if you want to dig into stuff like why we are, where we messed up, where we were geniuses, and what’s next, then read on.</p>
         <br>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">Else, TLDR:</p>
         <a href="/index.html">home  ↗<img src="arrow.png" class="filler" alt=""></a>
         <br>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">Farza said, and I couldn't agree more, "As founders, our job isn’t to be more likable, it isn’t to pretend like everything is okay or to be fine with average — it’s to solve the problems we set out to solve at the highest level possible." And at xlve, we believe the biggest problems have the simplest, most effective solutions.</p>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">I started this initiative at 15. I’m about 17 now. A lot has changed. The days are challenging, my hair is going grey — okay, maybe not that last part — but things are turning real, moving fast, and I’ve never been more excited.</p>
         
         <h2 data-aos="fade-down">The Beginning</h2>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">In 2021, we {Daniel and I} started graphic design and freelancing, in some sense. Then in 2022, we ended up building a film studio & company whose services were utilized in various events and even a fashion show at our high school. It was focused on not just shooting the videos but understanding the core concepts of the ideas, branding, and crafting a story that each frame would tell.</p>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">In 2023, we took a massive risk by pivoting from the film idea to something new — and that was the genesis of xlve.</p>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">The core principle was clear: we wanted to build a platform where anyone could work on things they were passionate about, tackle the world's most pressing issues, and dare to disrupt conventions. The idea was to enable individuals to solve problems, regardless of their background, status, or wealth. We believe that if you pursue what you’re passionate about and do it well enough, you’ll find greater success and fulfillment — not just for yourself but for society.</p>
         
         <p data-aos="fade-right">By late 2023, xlve started to gain traction. There were moments where life pulled us in different directions — college, personal projects, jobs — but this only made us more determined to build a platform that could adapt to these challenges. So we rebranded, restructured, and we’re back with fresh energy, ready to tackle real-world issues. We’re creating something where creatives, innovators, and problem-solvers can come together — think of it as a "Hogwarts" for problem-solvers, but grounded in reality.</p>
         
         <h2 data-aos="fade-down">Pivotal Moment</h2>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">We started pitching xlve to some of the most talented minds in tech, design, development, and creative arts. Many of them saw the potential, and that's when it clicked — xlve is more than just a project incubator. It’s a community where we build, collaborate, and turn innovative ideas into tangible solutions. This isn’t just about tech or creativity; it’s about merging the two to make a meaningful impact. We hope that people will join xlve not just to build projects but to shape a new way of thinking, problem-solving, and contributing to society.</p>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">Our community isn't just about creating products; it's about building things that can change the world, whether that’s through innovative tech, creative solutions, or transformative research. We aim to redefine how problems are approached and solved. We're here to serve the people in the middle, those who see problems but haven't had a platform to xolve them...until now.</p>
         
         <h2 data-aos="fade-down">Impact</h2>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">It feels impossible to summarize every great idea that has taken shape within xlve. Yet, every individual who has taken a bet on themselves and decided to join has contributed to a larger mission — to redefine what it means to solve real-world problems. And even though we are still growing, the stories and the numbers speak for themselves.</p>
         
         <h2 data-aos="fade-down">What We Believe In</h2>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">
             We believe innovation should not be exclusive. We believe in inclusivity, creativity, and meritocracy. Too often, traditional education and professional systems limit the ability to solve problems based on credentials or connections. At xlve, we challenge that notion. We are building a space where anyone, from anywhere, can learn, solve, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. Our mission is to empower problem-solvers, not to profit from them.
         </p>
         
         <h2 data-aos="fade-down">
             What’s Next
         </h2>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">
             With all this being said, here's what you should expect from us in 2024:
         </p>
         <ul>
             <li>We’re dedicating ourselves to developing xlve into a community-driven platform.</li>
             <li>We’re running our first full season of xlve, gathering innovators to solve real challenges.</li>
             <li>We're focusing on creating high-quality, impactful content to drive engagement and learning.</li>
             <li>We'll be launching a pilot of our collaborative problem-solving platform, aiming for broader participation soon after.</li>
         </ul>
         <p data-aos="fade-right">
             Thank you for being part of our journey so far. We’re excited to see where this goes, and we’re glad you’re here with us. If you have any questions or want to contribute, don’t hesitate to reach out.
         </p>
         <br>
         <br>
         <p>
             Best,
             <br>
             Victor Adewal, Co-founder  xlve.
