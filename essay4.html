        <h1>DEMOCRATIZING AND MERITOCRATIZING EDUCATION AND TALENT RECRUITMENT</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The modern education and recruitment systems are plagued by significant structural inefficiencies. It’s no news that prestigious schools frequently use outdated, overly standardized curricula that fail to adapt to the diverse abilities, interests, and learning styles of students. Furthermore, socioeconomic status plays a considerable role in determining access to quality education and career opportunities, often leaving the less privileged at a disadvantage. Studies show that educational outcomes are consistently linked to household income, with more affluent students accessing better educational resources and opportunities (Reardon, 2011). Similarly, internships, application fees, and fellowships remain out of reach for underprivileged students, further compounding inequities. In the job market, research suggests that networks and connections often outweigh merit in hiring processes (Rivera, 2012), creating barriers to merit-based opportunities. In response to these challenges, this paper advocates for democratizing and meritocratizing education and recruitment systems to foster equity and provide access based on competence rather than privilege.</p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>To ground this research, a mixed-methods approach was employed. The quantitative component involved secondary analysis of existing large-scale datasets on educational outcomes and labor market participation, including data from the U.S. Department of Education, Stanford University's Center for Education Policy Analysis, and other longitudinal studies. Qualitative insights were gained through interviews with educators, out twitter space, students, and recruiters across diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, combined with an extensive review of literature on educational inequalities and recruitment biases. Survey data were gathered from over 3,000 students across various institutions, which provided nuanced perspectives on the perceived fairness of education and employment systems, especially in terms of access and recognition.</p>

        <h2>The Problem with Current Education</h2>
        <h4>
            Historical Overview
        </h4>
        <p>Education, traditionally understood as a process of continuous learning and growth, has shifted from mentorship-based models to a standardized system that values formal schooling over individualized learning experiences. Historically, apprenticeships and mentorships were core to knowledge transmission, especially in trades and crafts, where recognized experts would pass down their skills to the next generation (Hanushek & Woessmann, 2011). This contrasts sharply with today’s education system, which has become increasingly bureaucratic and often treats education as a commodity (Collins, 1979).
        </p>

        <p>We’ve heard countless stories of great minds who thrived outside the conventional education system, as well as tales of top students who struggled after school. The reasons for this are manifold [Here, delve deeper into the reasons, such as psychological factors, socioeconomic backgrounds, and systemic issues]. Until recently, these flaws in the education system were not as apparent, but the pandemic has brought them to light. Is school a scam? Not entirely. The problem lies in the current system on which schools operate. Schools have become businesses, and students are treated as sources of revenue rather than learners.</p>

        <h2>
            Issues with Modern Schooling
        </h2>
        <p>Recent research indicates that over 70% of courses offered in colleges are either overpriced or irrelevant to students' primary fields of study (Selingo, 2013). For example, a disproportionate number of general education requirements bear little relation to students' majors, with students taking mandatory courses like culinary arts or music appreciation as part of engineering or business degrees (Bok, 2006). This misalignment leads to dissatisfaction and frustration among students. Data from the National Center for Education Statistics (2018) show that more than 60% of college graduates find themselves working in jobs unrelated to their degrees, with a significant portion remaining unemployed or underemployed despite their qualifications (Abel, Deitz, & Su, 2014).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, a survey of 3,000 students conducted as part of this study reveals that many students, especially those from low-income families, feel undervalued and overlooked in the academic system. They may excel in exams and coursework, but their actual potential remains unrecognized in a system that values institutional prestige over individual skill and creativity. The pandemic brought many of these inequities into sharper focus, as students from disadvantaged backgrounds struggled to access remote learning tools, thereby exacerbating existing disparities (Reich et al., 2020).</p>
        <p>The issues plaguing modern schooling in Nigeria are multifaceted, ranging from underfunding to systemic corruption, with dire consequences for the future of the nation. One of the most significant concerns is the insufficient ratio of GDP spent on education. Nigeria's spending on education consistently falls far short of global standards. In 2021, the country allocated just around 5.68% of its national budget to education, which is grossly inadequate when compared to the 26% recommended by UNESCO. This neglect results in underfunded schools, poor infrastructure, outdated teaching materials, and a chronic lack of professional development for teachers. The direct impact of this underinvestment is evident in the quality of graduates the system produces—many of whom struggle to find jobs due to an education system that fails to equip them with the skills needed for the 21st-century workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
            Graduate unemployment is another alarming issue. Despite the growing number of graduates churned out by universities each year, many struggle to secure employment in their fields. This isn’t just a reflection of the country's poor job market but also a testament to the declining standards in education. Employers often find that graduates lack essential skills, making them unemployable despite their degrees. The problem stems from outdated curricula, lack of practical knowledge, and insufficient exposure to real-world applications. As a result, the education system has become a factory producing graduates who cannot meet the needs of Nigeria's industries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the economic challenges, the moral decay within the education system is equally concerning. There is a growing prevalence of unethical behavior, particularly among lecturers who exploit their positions of power. It is becoming increasingly common for students, especially female students, to face sexual harassment and be coerced into exchanging sexual favors for better grades. This systemic abuse undermines the very fabric of education, turning academic achievement into something that can be bought rather than earned. The failure to adequately address these ethical breaches sends a clear message—that those in positions of power can get away with gross misconduct, thus eroding trust in the system and further demoralizing students.
        </p>

        <p>
            Society’s warped values further compound the problem. Fraudsters, or "Yahoo boys," who flaunt ill-gotten wealth are often celebrated rather than condemned, setting a terrible example for the younger generation. In a country where legitimate hard work and education often do not yield financial success, it is no surprise that the allure of quick, illicit money becomes stronger. This societal endorsement of fraud perpetuates the idea that education is not a path to prosperity but rather a waste of time. Consequently, many students lose faith in the value of schooling altogether.
        </p>

        <p>
            The overall decline in academic standards is another pressing issue. JAMB, Nigeria's unified tertiary matriculation exam, has seen dismal scores year after year. A score of 170 out of 400 is hardly commendable, yet students with these low scores still flood into higher institutions. The education system is forced to admit them, thereby lowering the overall academic rigor of universities. Meanwhile, the few students who manage to score above 300, which is a more competitive score, find themselves in the same classrooms as those who barely made the cut. This disparity creates an environment where students are not challenged according to their capabilities, and the learning process becomes diluted.
        </p>

        <p>
            To compound matters, there is a stark lack of merit-based scholarships for the few scholars who do excel. Those who are deserving of financial aid to further their education are often left to fend for themselves, as scholarships are either too few or given based on connections rather than merit. Meanwhile, underqualified and incompetent teachers dominate the classroom, further stagnating the learning process. In many cases, teachers themselves are products of a broken system—undereducated, underpaid, and demotivated. These teachers lack the passion and capability to ignite curiosity and creativity in their students, perpetuating the cycle of mediocrity in education.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, the abuse of power by the elite further exacerbates the inequality in Nigeria's educational system. Children of wealthy and influential individuals are often given preferential treatment, not only in terms of admissions into top-tier schools but also in securing top jobs. This blatant nepotism results in the saturation of critical positions in industries with individuals who did not earn their roles through merit but through connections. Meanwhile, graduates who are genuinely talented and deserving find themselves marginalized, unable to access the opportunities they deserve.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, it is impossible to ignore the disheartening reality that millions of children in Nigeria are not even in school. This is particularly tragic given the vast resources Nigeria possesses. Rather than prioritize education, politicians flaunt their wealth on social media, boasting of private jets, luxury cars, and opulent lifestyles. The disconnect between the ruling class and the needs of the people is stark and deeply troubling. While children go without education—effectively locking them into a cycle of poverty—those in power live in unimaginable luxury, indifferent to the struggles of the average Nigerian.
        </p>

        <p>
            The situation requires urgent and drastic measures. The Lagos State government, as a key player in the country’s educational framework, must take action to address these issues head-on. This includes significantly increasing the budget for education to meet global standards, enforcing strict consequences for unethical behavior among lecturers, and instituting merit-based scholarships and teacher training programs to improve the quality of education. Without these reforms, the future of Nigeria’s education system—and by extension, the country’s future—is in jeopardy. The need for accountability, fairness, and genuine investment in the intellectual growth of the nation’s youth has never been more critical.

        </p>

        
        <p>
            Education must be accessible to all, and all should b allowed to learn whatever they want regardless of socioeconomic status or geographic location. A 2019 Stanford study showed that disparities in access to quality education continue to widen, with lower-income students less likely to enroll in advanced coursework (Reardon, 2019). While digital platforms like MOOCs have expanded access to learning, the quality and structure of these resources remain inconsistent (Means et al., 2020).
        </p>

        <h2>The Limits of Meritocratic Equality of Opportunity</h2>
        <p>
            Meritocratic systems, while well-intentioned, often fail to account for the unequal distribution of resources necessary to develop merit. As Norman Daniels (1978) argues, merit alone cannot ensure justice if access to resources is unequally distributed. Even with policies promoting meritocracy, affluent individuals have a significant advantage in cultivating the skills valued by these systems. Paul Gomberg (2007) echoes this critique, emphasizing that true equality requires ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to contribute their talents to society.
        </p>

        <h2>Towards Fair Equality of Opportunity</h2>
        <p>
            In contrast to traditional meritocracy, the concept of Fair Equality of Opportunity (FEO) acknowledges the importance of equal access to educational resources, healthcare, and social support. Scholars like Israel Scheffler and Shlomi Segall argue that societies must ensure all individuals have an equal chance to develop the skills required for success. Amartya Sen’s *Merit and Justice* (2000) furthers this by linking merit to broader human flourishing, insisting that justice must play a role in fostering individual potential.
        </p>

        <h2>A New Solution: A Platform for Democratizing Merit and Learning</h2>
        <p>
            To address the limitations of traditional meritocracy, we propose an innovative platform that enables individuals to learn, rank, and be recognized based on their actual abilities, independent of background. This platform would curate high-quality educational resources and organize them into personalized learning paths. By providing structured, accessible educational opportunities in fields like programming, mathematics, and graphic design, we aim to democratize education and make learning outcomes more merit-based.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating a Merit-Based System</h2>
        <p>
            The proposed platform ranks students based on performance rather than background. This merit-based approach allows students to demonstrate their competence through measurable achievements, similar to academic competitions like the International Mathematical Olympiad (Toplak et al., 2011). This system would also benefit recruitment processes, enabling companies to assess potential hires based on demonstrated skills rather than credentials alone (Rivera, 2012).
